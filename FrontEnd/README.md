> A Vue.js project

## Running Locally
```
cd ./FrontEnd/
npm install
npm run build
npm run localstart
```
Should now be up at http://localhost:5000/

## Build Setup
this stuff was put in by vue, just leaving it behind

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
